 ## Objective

 Create a small classical CISC computer simulated in java.

 Phases:

 1. Basic Machine
  - Design and implement the basic machine architecture.
   - Implement a simple memory
    - Execute Load and Store instructions
     - Build initial user interface to simulator

     2. Memory and Cache Design
      - Design and implement the modules for enhanced memory and cache operations
       - Extend the user interface.
        - Demonstrate 1st program running on the simulator.

	3. Execute All Instructions
	 - Make sure all instructions ( as specified below) execute on the simulator
	  - Demonstrate 2nd program running on the simulator

##Using Git

	  Git is version control service that enables users to track progress and changes to a project. Different versions of a project reside in different **branches**. Files must be added to a commit log and then committed to a branch before the changes are visible to all users. If a branch provides functionality useful to the primary branch then it can be **merged** back into the primary branch.

	  Below are some useful commands to get you started on using Git with Bitbucket.

	  `git branch` This will show you what branch you are working on (think of branches as different versions of the project). We will try to work primarily in the **master** branch.

	  `git branch [branch name]` This command creates a new branch. You should branch your work if you are making substantial changes to the project.

	  `git pull` This command will pull down the latest version of the branch you are working on.

	  `git add [filename]` This command will add the changed file the list of files to be commtited

	  `git add .` This will add all modified files to the list of files to be committed.

	  `git commit -m [commit name]` This command will commit all of the changes (make them official) that have been added.

	  `git push` This command will push all of the committed changes up to bitbucket
